# VRAM Expansion Board for Compaq S3 Virge GX & Matrox Mystique 220 Video Cards

<img src="/Pics/main.jpg" width=600>

The Compaq S3 Virge GX video card comes with 2MB of VRAM onboard, and a dual pin header interface for an add-on board to upgrade up to 4MB VRAM in total.

However, this add-on board is difficult to find at a reasonable price nowadays. Hence the need for this project.

Also, I've added additional support for a BIOS chip with a modern pinout scheme, in contrast to the weird one Compaq decided to use on their card. Just in case you are facing a corrupted BIOS situation, you can easily remove the stock one and install your own.

## Extra Compatibility

Later, I've noticed that this expansion board is also completely compatible with the Compaq Matrox Mystique 220, boosting the total VRAM to 4MB.
