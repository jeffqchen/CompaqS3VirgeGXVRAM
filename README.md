# VRAM Expansion Board for Compaq S3 Virge GX Video Card

<img src="/Pics/main.jpg" width=600>

The Compaq S3 Virge GX video card comes with 2MB of VRAM onboard, and a dual pin header interface for an add-on board to upgrade up to 4MB VRAM in total.

However, this add-on board is difficult to find at a reasonable price nowadays. Hence the need for this project.

Also, I've added additional support for a BIOS chip with a modern pinout scheme, in contrast to the weird one Compaq decided to use on their card. Just in case you are facing a corrupted BIOS situation, you can easily remove the stock one and install your own.

To learn all the findings I obtained during creating this board, as well as how to build the board, please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/jeffqchen/CompaqS3VirgeGXVRAM/wiki) pages.
